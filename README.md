# BluetoothEspresso
a bluetooth espresso machine

Purpose:  To PID enable a mid-level pump espresso machine and add a timer for pulling shots.

I am using an arduino outfitted with an atmega328.  A thermocouple, BTmodule, Solidstate Relay, and a mechanical relay will be used.
I decided Bluetooth, dont want a russian hacker makeing espresso on my machine.
